Run `npm i` first to get all the dependencies

To run the server enter the command `npm start`

To run the server on a specific port enter the command `node index.js --port=1234` <br>
Or alternatively modify the `start` script in `package.json` so the port number that is passed in is the one you want.

Replace the `dist` folder with the folder containing the html/css/js files that you want to server <br>
(This folder must also be called `dist`)
